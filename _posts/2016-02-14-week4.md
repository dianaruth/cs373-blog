Please excuse my mild delirium because I'm running on about 5 hours of sleep in the past three nights thanks to the horse show this weekend.

- What did you do this past week?

    I started the Netflix project with my partner this week. I completed the project last semester but my RMSE was *at* 1.00 so I got tons of points off. That's what you get for not reading the project specification carefully enough, so I really learned my lesson. So since my code wasn't working properly, I was given permission to get a partner for this project and we've been working diligently on it. Unfortunately, we haven't managed to get our RMSE for probe.txt under 1.00, so that's still in the works. I changed my code from using JSON caches to using pickle caches, just because I heard the pickle format is really fast for Python to process.

- What's in your way?

    We really need to get that RMSE down to finish this project. I also have two tests coming up in the next two weeks and they're both worth a huge chunk of my grade for those classes, so I really want to make sure I'm prepared to do well on these tests.

- What will you do next week?

    Take lots of tests and submit my Netflix project. I just really need to make a big effort to stay ahead of everything and do well on these assignments.

I also installed Atom because everyone has been buzzing about it, and I have to say I'm really impressed with it. The themes are clean and attractive, it lets you know which files in your GitHub repositories have changed, and it even has a spellcheck feature which is really useful.

In an article we had to read earlier in the semester, one of Joel Spolsky's tips was to excel in non-CS stuff. Well, I'm the president of the school's equestrian team and I've really enjoyed it so far. It's a good stress reliever for me since I've been riding since I was eight years old. and I want to brag on my team for a minute since I've already produced my 250 words about software engineering for the week. We had a show this weekend (our competitions are called "shows") in Dripping Springs hosted by Texas State. I have an injured knee right now so I couldn't show this weekend, but many of my girls did their jumping classes for the first time this weekend and they looked phenomenal. Just check out these ribbons.

I was happy to have a break from all my really tough EE and CS classes this weekend and while I'm pretty behind right now and will likely spend the entire night tonight catching up, being at the show this weekend was worth it. I love being part of (and in charge of) a collegiate sports team and I'm thankful for the opportunity every day. Although I have to say it's very strange being around so many girls for once, because in my classes I'm surrounded by guys. But I had a lot of fun this weekend supporting my team!

Tip of the Week
---------------

Make time to do things outside of your classes. It's important to experience all the things the big beautiful world has to offer and you can't experience a lot of those things from behind a computer screen.
